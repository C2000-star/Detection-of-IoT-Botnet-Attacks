# Detection of IoT Botnet Attacks

Abstract:

Abstractâ€”The growing adoption of Internet-of-Things devices brings with it the increased participation of said devices in botnet attacks, and as such novel methods for IoT botnet attack detection are needed. The paper proposes a network- based anomaly detection method for the IoT called N-BaIoT. This extracts behavior snapshots of the network and uses deep autoencoders to detect anomalous network traffic from compro- mised IoT devices. The autoencoders have more than one hidden layer. To evaluate the method, the paper has taken dataset of nine infected commercial IoT devices with two widely known IoT-based botnets, Mirai and BASHLITE. The results proved the accuracy of the model. An anomaly detection and attack classification pipeline has been implemented. LIME has been used to explain the features that contribute to the prediction.
